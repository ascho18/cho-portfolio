## User Research and Interviews 

### Target Audience 

My target audience is a general American public&dash;not lawmakers or policymakers, but just concerned citizens that want to and should have more awareness about hardships that the AAPI community is going through. And this is not just limited to people outside of the AAPI community, but for others in the AAPI community as well&mdash;anyone that does not have the information or realization about how severe the discrimination others in the AAPI community are going through. 

Given that getting involved to prevent discrimination and to spread awareness is pretty accessible with anyone that has social media or access to the Internet, I also imagine audiences of most ages would be able to both absorb this information as well as get more involved if they chose to. This would include going to websites, donating, and getting involved in the conversation some way even with their friends, colleagues, and family members. 

### Identifying Interviewees 

Because of my broad scope of an audience, I tried to reach out to peers that were both part of and were not part of the AAPI community as well as interviewees that were older than me to try and capture the spread of ages that this story should speak to and inform. As such, I interviewed two of my friends&mdash;one who is my age and part of the AAPI community and one who is a few years older than me and is not part of the AAPI community&mdash;and interviewed my parents, who are also part of the AAPI community.
