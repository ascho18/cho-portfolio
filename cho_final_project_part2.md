## Wireframes and Storyboards 

For wireframing and storyboarding, I made a [rough draft](https://preview.shorthand.com/sTWXaHMSXwBs0GSn) of my final project in Shorthand. I focused on getting the overall story put together and get the visualizations down. There were some spaces that had not been totally written out yet, but as it is, this version is the one that I showed my users for research. 

## User Research and Interviews 

### Target Audience 

My target audience is a general American public&dash;not lawmakers or policymakers, but just concerned citizens that want to and should have more awareness about hardships that the AAPI community is going through. And this is not just limited to people outside of the AAPI community, but for others in the AAPI community as well&mdash;anyone that does not have the information or realization about how severe the discrimination others in the AAPI community are going through. 

Given that getting involved to prevent discrimination and to spread awareness is pretty accessible with anyone that has social media or access to the Internet, I also imagine audiences of most ages would be able to both absorb this information as well as get more involved if they chose to. This would include going to websites, donating, and getting involved in the conversation some way even with their friends, colleagues, and family members. 

### Identifying Interviewees 

Because of my broad scope of an audience, I tried to reach out to peers that were both part of and were not part of the AAPI community as well as interviewees that were older than me to try and capture the spread of ages that this story should speak to and inform. As such, I interviewed two of my friends&mdash;one who is my age and part of the AAPI community and one who is a few years older than me and is not part of the AAPI community&mdash;and interviewed my parents, who are also part of the AAPI community. 

### The Research Method 

#### Goals/Questions 

| Goal                | Question | 
| --------------------|----------|
| Evaluate Story | Do people unfamiliar with AAPI discrimination learn that it is happening during COVID-19? Do people feel moved to get more involved or informed? Do people feel informed about what they can do to get involved? |
| What is confusing, if anything? | | 
| Prioritize what to fix | What problems are most severe? | 

#### Metrics 

* Whether participants understand the types of discrimination and severity of discrimination of the AAPI community since COVID-19 
* Whether participants feel moved to get involved or become more informed 
* Whether participants understand how to get involved or to get more information 

### The Script 

#### Introduction 

**Brief Introduction**: Hi, I'm Abby, and I'm currently doing a project for CMU's Telling Stories with Data class. 

**Description of purpose**: "My goal today is to get feedback on a draft of my project. I want to know if participants such as you understand the data and story in the project, see if there are places that could be improved, and see what is confusing about the project, if anything. All feedback is anonymous and should not take more than 15 minutes of your time." 

"Your feedback will be anonymous. However, because of the nature of my project, it is helpful for me to record your demographic data such as your age and ethnicity. Do I have permission from you to record that data? Remember that this data will not be associated with your name in any way." 

"Please remember that I am testing my project and not you! If you are confused or unsure at any point, that is a reflection on the material, and I am looking for these places so I can make the information more clear." 

#### Main section

**Demographics**: What is your age and ethnicity? 

"I have a page here hosted on Shorthand which will be telling a story and sharing data about a certain topic. Please open the page and make note of anything you find confusing or unclear, such as a word, phrase, or section. If you see anything that interests you or that you like, let me know. In the inverse, if there's something you'd like to see less of or doesn't interest you, let me know."

As they walk through the story, ask follow-up questions as necessary, let the participant work through the page at their own pace and with their own process, and respond to questions they have and note what is asked. 

**Post Questions**: 

1. Can you tell me, in your own words, what you think this page is for? 
2. Can you tell me how you feel after going through this page? 
3. Do you feel motivated to do something after reading this page? If so, how would you get involved?
4. Do you have any other questions about this site? Is there anything else you'd want to know? 

#### Wrap-Up 

"Do you have any other questions for me?" 

"Thank you so much for your time. If you want to follow up with me for any reason, feel free to contact me at any time." 

### Findings 

**User One** 

User one was outside of the AAPI community and was in his 20s. Overall, user one's feedback was quite positive. He liked the font choices and color, and he felt that the data visualizations were appropriate and easy for him to read. He thought the story was easy to follow, where the story was presenting data to back up the claim, then moved on to a call to action at the end. From the beginning, he said he was aware that this would be about AAPI discrimination from the title and introduction. He also assumed it would probably talk about what can be done to stop it, so he was expecting the call to action at the end. He had some trouble differentiating between links and simply bolded text since they were the same color, however. 

**User Two** 

User two was a member of the AAPI community and was in her 40s. She liked the writing, but said she was confused about the overall message. It wasn't clear to her from the beginning what the purpose of this story was: was it to educate, or to tell people how to help? When she was reading through the data, she thought that it was just meant to educate people on what was going on with AAPI discrimination, but when she got to the call to action, she thought that the purpose was to get people to help instead. 

User two also found the changing pie charts with the scrollmation feature in Shorthand to be too subtle. She almost didn't see the charts change into a second one while she was finished with the corresponding paragraphs and made to scroll to the next section. She also completely missed the next scrollmation section with the visualizations using people.

User two also did not know what "AAPI" meant and wondered what it meant when reading the title card. 

Overall, user two said once she got to the end, she understood the purpose of the page, and she thought the writing and graphs overall were helpful. She just wanted to know the purpose earlier on in her reading experience. 

**User Three** 

User three was part of the AAPI community and was in his 20s. Overall, user three thought that the story was very informative and straightforward. He did not have trouble following the storyline nor reading any of the visualizations. He felt the visualizations were helpful overall. However, he did have some comments on them: on the pie charts, he wondered if there should be percent values in the sections since the title had percentages in it, and on the chart with gender distribution, it was not immediately obvious to him which color was female and which color was male. 

In addition, user three expressed that he felt like there was some overlap feeling between the red bolded text and the red underlined links and thought that styling was a little confusing. 

### Implemented Changes 

Based on user feedback, I'll be making the following changes to the final draft: 

* Defining AAPI somewhere earlier, probably on the title card. It's later defined in the next "slide", the introduction, but for people unfamiliar with it, it should be spelled out early. 
* Breaking out the visualizations from the scrollmation feature on Shorthand and just displaying the visualizations statically on the page. Ensuring the users see the data is more important than making things fancy! 
* Try and adjust language in the beginning, such as the intro, to give a better roadmap of what the story will be about: raising *both* awareness and how to help. 
* Adding a legend to the gender distribution visualization to make it clear which color corresponds to which gender 
* Adjusting the styling between links and bold-emphasized text. Might just need to make the bold text black instead of red.
