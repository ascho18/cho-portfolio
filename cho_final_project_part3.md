## Reflection 

### Identifying the Audience 

My final project really started when I heard from my uncle that my granpda was considering buying a gun because he was afraid of getting hurt or assaulted while going outside. My grandfather immigrated to the United States from South Korea in the 70s and has lived in the States since. He's one of the kindest people I've ever known, and I couldn't imagine him holding a gun&mdash;let alone being that afraid of going outside that he felt getting one was necessary. 

My uncle was able to talk my grandpa out of buying a gun, but hearing that story made me want to inform audiences about the hate that's happening so we can do something about it. With that in mind, I wanted to inform not only those outside the Asian and Pacific Islander communities, but those within it that might not be aware of how _severe_ some of the hate or discrimination might be for others in the States. 

However, my project had an implicit narrowing factor: I used English for my narration and visualizations. While I was doing research, I found a few sources (that I did not end up referencing in my final project) that discussed some bias that may arise when polling Asian communities because the polls were usually conducted in English or Spanish. Meanwhile, many immigrants such as my grandpa may not speak English well enough to take part in those polls, be informed about resources, or submit information to help centers. That meant that my data and my audience was limited to English speaking Asian and Pacific Islanders in America and other English speakers. 

It wasn't feasible for me to make my project accessible for all languages, so I accepted this narrower audience and wanted to make note of it here.

### Design Choices 

Overall, I didn't have too many design choices while I was revising the work. Most of the critique were in small details: changing some of the red color on the dark backgrounds, for example, to a darker red because one of my users thought that the contrast was too high and it was hard to read. Another change was adjusting the "female" units in my gender unit chart to another warm color other than red, since I had used red already for "general" populations and not just women. This distinction was made during user feedback when a few users told me they were momentarily confused because I used red for "general" populations in an earlier unit chart, so when they arrived at the red for "female" in the gender unit chart, they at first thought it was general populations again or wondered if the general populations were also meant to be women. I also added a legend to this gender unit chart. At first I didn't do this because the origianl chart was interactive, and hovering over each unit gave what it represented (i.e. "female", "male", "transgender or non-binary"), so I assumed users would be able to get this information by interacting with the chart. However, one of my users did not hover over the chart and thus did not know which color represented what. In lieu of this, I also added a "hover over" subititle for applicable visualizations so audiences
