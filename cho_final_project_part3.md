## Reflection 

### Identifying the Audience 

My final project really started when I heard from my uncle that my grandpa was considering buying a gun because he was afraid of getting hurt or assaulted while going outside. My grandfather immigrated to the United States from South Korea in the 70s and has lived in the States since. He's one of the kindest people I've ever known, and I couldn't imagine him holding a gun&mdash;let alone being that afraid of going outside that he felt getting one was necessary. 

My uncle was able to talk my grandpa out of buying a gun, but hearing that story made me want to inform audiences about the hate that's happening so we can do something about it. With that in mind, I wanted to inform not only those outside the Asian and Pacific Islander communities, but those within it that might not be aware of how _severe_ some of the hate or discrimination might be for others in the States. 

However, my project had an implicit narrowing factor: I used English for my narration and visualizations. While I was doing research, I found a few sources (that I did not end up referencing in my final project) that discussed some bias that may arise when polling Asian communities because the polls were usually conducted in English or Spanish. Meanwhile, many immigrants such as my grandpa may not speak English well enough to take part in those polls, be informed about resources, or submit information to help centers. That meant that my data and my audience was limited to English speaking Asian and Pacific Islanders in America and other English speakers. 

It wasn't feasible for me to make my project accessible for all languages, so I accepted this narrower audience and wanted to make note of it here.

### Design Choices 

#### Initial Choices 

I knew I wanted to create something personal and human for this project so audiences could connect to the subject I was discussing. I knew I wanted to use quotations directly from the [National Hate Report](https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.69.231/a1w.90d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Stop_AAPI_Hate_National_Report_200805.pdf) that I found, which had personal accounts from individuals about their experiences. I felt these personal words would affect and move audiences to action. I also used photos of members of the Asian and Pacific Islander community for similar reasons. 

Otherwise, my color palette choices were very simple. I used a mix of black, dark grey, white, and red primarily. I chose red because it is commonly associated with many eastern cultures, and most popularly in China. I thought it'd be an appropriate choice given the rhetoric of the "Chinese virus" that went around about COVID-19, and I thought it was also a nice contrast on the dark grey or darker shades I incorporated into the story as well as stood out well on white backgrounds. 

#### Revisions 

Overall, there were not many changes when I went to revise my work. Most of the critique were in small details: changing some of the red color on the dark backgrounds, for example, to a darker red because one of my users thought that the contrast was too high and it was hard to read. Another change was adjusting the "female" units in my gender unit chart to another warm color other than red, since I had used red already for "general" populations and not just women. This distinction was made during user feedback when a few users told me they were momentarily confused because I used red for "general" populations in an earlier unit chart, so when they arrived at the red for "female" in the gender unit chart, they at first thought it was general populations again or wondered if the general populations were also meant to be women. I also added a legend to this gender unit chart. At first I didn't do this because the original chart was interactive, and hovering over each unit gave what it represented (i.e. "female", "male", "transgender or non-binary"), so I assumed users would be able to get this information by interacting with the chart. However, one of my users did not hover over the chart and thus did not know which color represented what. In lieu of this, I also added a "hover over" subtitle for applicable visualizations so audiences knew that they could interact with the charts for more information.

I also made a few changes to the language. I originally used "AAPI", or "Asian-American and Pacific Islander", to describe the community that was being discriminated against. One of my users from the GSA, however, informed me that using this term may be alienating to Asians in America that are not "American", or are not citizens. She suggested that I change my language to adjust for this in my story. Of course, I wanted to be as inclusive as possible for all Asians that are subject to discrimination, not just Asian-Americans, so I instead used "Asian and Pacific Islander" instead in my final version. 

Stylistically, my users also had problems differentiating between links and bolded text in the story because they both used red. I wanted to keep the color differentiation for these styles, and I didn't really want to add a new color into the mix when I consistently used only red everywhere else, so instead, I just added some explicit underlines under my links. 

I also noticed while one of my users was scrolling through the story that they did not notice the visualizations changed on the right when I used an animation feature in Shorthand. I realized this change is too subtle, so I took out the animations and just put the visualizations underneath each other statically. I think this works out well anyway because it lets users compare visualizations next to each other if they wish. 

One of my final additions was putting in a section linking to my data sets and photo sources. My data sources were linked inline during my story, but I wanted to have a place for them to be explicitly shown. I thought I would include the photo sources as well in the same credits section. 

There was some feedback I did not incorporate. One of my users also wondered if the ethnic distribution of victims might be a unit chart instead of a tree map. I decided against changing it from a tree map for a few reasons: one, I felt like the tree map showed the distribution of ethnicities well, and I wasn't sure how I'd color code or differentiate them in a unit chart; second, because I already had a number of unit charts in the story, and I didn't want to create a monotonous chain of similar visualizations in the story. 

### What I Learned 

I definitely learned that sometimes simple is better. I wanted to incorporate some fun animations and interactive things with the scrolling animation in Shorthand, for example, but it turned out those were not effective for audiences because they weren't even noticeable. Obviously, it's more important that the audience notices the visualizations rather than thinks the animation looks cool, so I definitely learned my lesson that sometimes the bells and whistles can detract from the overall message. 

Similarly, I learned that you can't assume the audience will try to interact with everything, such as one of my users that did not interact with some of my interactive visualizations and thus did not know what some of the colors represented. I learned that it's better to be explicit, and there's no need to be minimalistic when it comes to informing the audiences about what they can do with the visualizations and how they can interact with them.
