## Outline 

For my project, I hope to cover the anti-Asian-American sentiment that's risen in America since the start of COVID-19. This sentiment includes believing Asian-Americans are to blame for coronavirus as well as manifesting in hate crimes against Asian-American and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs). Ultimately, after increasing awareness on the situation, I want to suggest to audiences actions they can take to help AAPIs, whether through stepping in when they witness acts of discrimination or getting involved in their community.
