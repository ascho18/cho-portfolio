## Outline 

For my project, I hope to cover the anti-Asian-American sentiment that's risen in America since the start of COVID-19. This sentiment includes believing Asian-Americans are to blame for coronavirus as well as manifesting in hate crimes against Asian-American and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs). Ultimately, after increasing awareness on the situation, I want to suggest to audiences actions they can take to help AAPIs, whether through stepping in when they witness acts of discrimination or getting involved in their community.

## The data 

### New Center for Public Integrity/Ipsos Poll finds most Americans say the Coronavirus Pandemic is a Natural Disaster 

This data set is a poll conducted by the New Center for Public Integrity from April, 2020. The poll asked idnividuals if they believed if COVID-19 is a natural disaster or an event that a group/organization is responsible for. If they responded the latter, then were then asked if they believed China or Asians were responsible for the pandemic. All individuals were asked questions on if they would feel uncomfortable if someone of Asian descent approached them during the pandemic. This poll demonstrates that there is some anti-AAPI sentiment that exists in the American public. 

The article that the dataset was found from can be found [here](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/center-for-public-integrity-poll-2020). The dataset can be found [here](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-04/topline-center-for-public-integrity-042820.pdf). 

I plan on using the results of the poll, including the number of participants and the number of responses to a variety of the questions, to demonstrate that there is anti-AAPI sentiment and that the hate crimes against the AAPI community aren't coming from nowhere, and in fact, they are being fueled by the coronavirus. I do not believe I will be differentiating between Democrats and Republicans, however, since political affiliation isn't particularly relevant to what I'm exploring. 

### Stop AAPI Hate National Report 

This data set is a report from August, 2020. Stop AAPI Hate is an organization that was made in response to the increased rate of hate crimes against the AAPI community during the pandemic. Stop AAPI Hate encouraged AAPIs to report any hate crimes that were done against them to their org so they could document and release the rates. This national report covers all the reports they received from March, 2020 to August, 2020. 

Stop AAAPI Hate's official page can be found [here](https://stopaapihate.org/). Their national report can be found [here](https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.69.231/a1w.90d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Stop_AAPI_Hate_National_Report_200805.pdf). 



## Method and Medium 

To complete this project, I'll be following the laid out suggestions we've been practicing in class. I will be sketching and wireframing potential visualizations for the project and reaching out to friends for user testing. For the purposes of this project, I'm hoping to get in contact with both friends who are part of the AAPI community and are not to ensure I have a variety of feedback. Ideally, I would also like to reach out to my older relatives, since it was partially because of them that I was inspired to look at this subject. 

For my data visualizations, I plan on using either Tableau, Flourish, or a combination of both as needed. At the moment, the data
