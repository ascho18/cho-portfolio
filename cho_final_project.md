## Outline 

For my project, I hope to cover the anti-Asian-American sentiment that's risen in America since the start of COVID-19. This sentiment includes believing Asian-Americans are to blame for coronavirus as well as manifesting in hate crimes against Asian-American and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs). Ultimately, after increasing awareness on the situation, I want to suggest to audiences actions they can take to help AAPIs, whether through stepping in when they witness acts of discrimination or getting involved in their community. 

I am imagining structuring my project as the following: first, by connecting to the audience and understanding that COVID-19 has affected us all&mdash;but some groups, in addition to being affected by COVID-19, have suffered from increased discrimination and challenges. Then, I focus to the scope to the AAPI community, where I will be bringing in data that shows that since the start of the pandemic, Asian-Americans have suffered an increase in hate crimes and discrimination, that data support anti-Asian sentiment exists in the US, and that data shows this discrimination has increased since before the start of the pandemic. The point of this segment of the project is to induce a sense of urgency in the audience and get them to both understand that this is a problem that exists and ask what they can do to help. Finally, as a resolution, I plan to share efforts that have been done, such as [resolutions that passed through the House](https://meng.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-passes-meng-resolution-to-denounce-anti-asian-sentiment-related-to) to denounce anti-Asian sentiments (although it did not get fully approved) and methods on how to be effective allies, reach out to members of the community that audiences know, and how to intervene when audiences notice discrimination. I aim to leave audiences with a sense of resolve and hope that not only are there steps that can be taken, but there are steps that can be taken by the individual. 

## Initial Sketches 

## The data 

### New Center for Public Integrity/Ipsos Poll finds most Americans say the Coronavirus Pandemic is a Natural Disaster 

This data set is a poll conducted by the New Center for Public Integrity from April, 2020. The poll asked idnividuals if they believed if COVID-19 is a natural disaster or an event that a group/organization is responsible for. If they responded the latter, then were then asked if they believed China or Asians were responsible for the pandemic. All individuals were asked questions on if they would feel uncomfortable if someone of Asian descent approached them during the pandemic. This poll demonstrates that there is some anti-AAPI sentiment that exists in the American public. 

The article that the dataset was found from can be found [here](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/center-for-public-integrity-poll-2020). The dataset can be found [here](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-04/topline-center-for-public-integrity-042820.pdf). 

I plan on using the results of the poll, including the number of participants and the number of responses to a variety of the questions, to demonstrate that there is anti-AAPI sentiment and that the hate crimes against the AAPI community aren't coming from nowhere, and in fact, they are being fueled by the coronavirus. I do not believe I will be differentiating between Democrats and Republicans, however, since political affiliation isn't particularly relevant to what I'm exploring. 

### Many Black and Asian Americans Say They Have Experienced Discrimination Amid the COVID-19 Outbreak

A poll was conducted by the Pew Research Center for Social and Demographic Trends that asked if Asians and Black Americans believed they experienced more discrimination after the pandemic. This data is interesting because it documents whether or not these groups felt they were discriminated against more after as well as *before* the pandemic, which I believe could be an interesting statistic to support the idea that there has been an increase in discrimination since COVID-19 arrived in the US. I'm still debating on using this dataset, as I'm not sure if the Ipsos poll might be enough to support the idea that discrimination has increased since COVID-19 began, but I'm including it here for completion. 

The article can be found [here](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/07/01/many-black-and-asian-americans-say-they-have-experienced-discrimination-amid-the-covid-19-outbreak/). 

Of course, for the purposes of this project, I will be pulling numbers exclusively for the AAPI community from this article. As far as I can tell, they have not released their raw dataset, but I believe I will be able to put together some numbers based on their visualizations. 

### Stop AAPI Hate National Report 

This data set is a report from August, 2020. Stop AAPI Hate is an organization that was made in response to the increased rate of hate crimes against the AAPI community during the pandemic. Stop AAPI Hate encouraged AAPIs to report any hate crimes that were done against them to their org so they could document and release the rates. This national report covers all the reports they received from March, 2020 to August, 2020. 

Stop AAAPI Hate's official page can be found [here](https://stopaapihate.org/). Their national report can be found [here](https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.69.231/a1w.90d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Stop_AAPI_Hate_National_Report_200805.pdf). 

I plan on using the reported hate crimes from this report to show that hate crimes are happening, and they have been happening in relation to the coronavirus (especially the "coughed/spat on" metric, which seems to be a pointedly COVID-related offense). The report itself actually has mostly basic visualizations and percent values for their metrics. However, the report does note that the total number of reports are 2583 in the inital summary, so while I will not be able to directly pull data from every metric, I'll be able to calculate the actual numbers based on the percentages and totals so I can manipulate the data myself. 

## Method and Medium 

To complete this project, I'll be following the laid out suggestions we've been practicing in class. I will be sketching and wireframing potential visualizations for the project and reaching out to friends for user testing. For the purposes of this project, I'm hoping to get in contact with both friends who are part of the AAPI community and are not to ensure I have a variety of feedback. Ideally, I would also like to reach out to my older relatives, since it was partially because of them that I was inspired to look at this subject. 

For my data visualizations, I plan on using either Tableau, Flourish, or a combination of both as needed. At the moment, the data is fairly straightforward; for the polling data, I can pull directly from their results, and for the hate report, I can calculate numerical values myself to put into whatever program I use.

In order to put together the story for my final project, I plan on using Shorthand. Based on the demonstrations in class, Shorthand seems like a fairly straightfoward and effective medium to put together my project. I do not anticipate I will be using any physical or immersive materials for the purposes of this project. 

I hope to use the data I've gathered to demonstrate that discrimination is present and that it is happening to create a sense of urgency amongst the audience. Then, I am planning on resolving the story by suggesting acts that the audience can do in the face of discrimination: first, be informed and aware, and inform others about the coronavirus. Second, to step in and not be afraid to be an ally, whether that be reaching out to someone you know in the AAPI community or speaking up when you witness discrimination happening. At the moment, while I am finding resources about bystander intervention and how to be effective allies, I am not finding numerical data around such topics. I am hoping to find some supporting data about the positive effects about getting involved. I'm also currently also looking through US' SARS response from many years ago against anti-Asian sentiments, as the CDC actually made efforts to educate and inform audiences about SARS to combat AAPI discrimination, to see if there is any data that demonstrated discrimination went down so I can make comparisons to COVID-19 today. 

In addition to using the data from the hate report, I am also considering using some of the personal stories starting on page 9 for the purposes of the story, such as using some quotes for effect. I believe having these personal recollections in combination with the data would create a more persuasive story and project, connecting the data with personal experiences and others that we can relate to. Of course, I do not anticipate I will be documenting the quotations in data visualizations, but they may appear as accents in the story timeline. 

For the final presentation, I believe I'm going to simply present my Shorthand page to the class while summarizing my findings and personal connection to the topic. At the moment, I am not planning on creating additional materials for the final presentation.
