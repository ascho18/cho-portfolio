# About Me 
I'm Abby (she/her), and I'm currently pursuing an MA in Professional Writing at CMU. I also completed my BS in Technical Writing at CMU and worked as a technical writer at a cybersecurity/tech company for a few years before coming back to school. This company mostly was contracted with the U.S. government, and it had quite a few projects coming out of DARPA, so there was some pretty cool stuff going on! 

My main interest is working with engineers and scientists in the technology and hard sciences fields to create documentation and rhetoric that is accessible and exciting for general users and audiences, including those that do not have technical backgrounds. I've always had an interest in sciences as well as writing, and I especially loved the intersection between writing and science. Still, when I first came to CMU, I started out as a physics major rather than a technical writing major, and I believed that outside of textbooks or science news articles, the only way I could write about science was through publications. It was only after a few years that I learned about technical writing and technical communication, and that's when I made the switch over to technical writing. 

After I graduate, I will be working at another government contractor as the primary writer on a new contract they are acquiring this summer. This is pretty exciting for me, since at my previous position, I was only a junior writer. Now, I'll be taking on more responsibility and becoming more involved in a project, which will (hopefully) be a great experience. 

# What I Hope to Learn 
I am primarily interested in learning the basics of data visualization so I have a better understanding of this subject that I've run into in the past. I have experience as a technical writer working with engineers, software developers, and data scientists developing cybersecurity technology. While I mostly worked with words and text, there were many times I had to put together reports and presentations that had data visualizations or otherwise revise work done by other staff that included data visualizations. What I've found is that images, including data visualizations, contribute to arguments as much as text does. Images convey meaning, and sometimes this meaning can be helpful, but at other times, it can be misleading. As a communicator, especially as a communicator in technical fields where visualizations are common, it's my hope that I learn more about what makes data visualizations helpful or hindering, and how I can create useful visualizations as well as assist my professional peers in the future.
