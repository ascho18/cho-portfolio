# About Me 
I'm Abby (she/her), and I'm currently pursuing an MA in Professional Writing at CMU. I also completed my BS in Technical Writing at CMU and worked as a technical writer at a cybersecurity/tech company for a few years before coming back to school.

# What I Hope to Learn 
I am primarily interested in learning the basics of data visualization so I have a better understanding of this subject that I've run into in the past. I have experience as a technical writer working with engineers, software developers, and data scientists developing cybersecurity technology. While I mostly worked with words and text, there were many times I had to put together reports and presentations that had data visualizations or otherwise revise work done by other staff that included data visualizations. Through this course, I hope I can gain a more speicalized knowledge about data visualization in order to better interact with data as well as my peers.
