## Asian-American COVID-19 Related Discrimination 

For this assignment, we were tasked to take an existing data visualization from the wild and redesign it based on our own critiques of it. The visualization I chose to critique and redesign is this one:

![Types of Discrimination](https://i.imgur.com/nB6VsDw.png)

This visualization was taken from a [bigger report](https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.69.231/a1w.90d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Stop_AAPI_Hate_CA_Report_200630.pdf) provided by the [Stop AAPI Hate](https://stopaapihate.org/) organization. This organization was put together in the face of the rising rate of hate crimes and discrimination against Asian-Americans in the United States amidst COVID-19. As can be seen in the visualization above, this graph shows the amount of discrimination by type in California and America as a whole over the past "thirteen weeks", according to the report. This report [is listed](https://stopaapihate.org/reportsreleases/) as being published on June 30, 2020, so the data for this visualization spans from late March to late June 2020.  

I chose this visualization for a few reasons. First, this topic is personally relevant to me. I am Asian-American, and further, I have family in California who have shared with me that they have faced discrimination since the start of COVID-19. Recently, my uncle in California told me about how his parents&mdash;my grandparents&mdash;were afraid to go out because of a rash of physical assaults and mugging incidents towards elderly Asian-Americans in their area. My grandpa has never been afraid to go out before&mdash;in fact, he always said how grateful he was to start a new life in America after immigrating here&mdash;so to hear him say something like this both broke my heart and got me interested in just how severe the uptick in crimes against Asian-Americans was. I was happy to find that this data was being recorded and visualized! 

## Critique and Redesign Process 

For the purposes of this assignment, we first critiqued our chosen visualization using Stephen Few's (Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile)[http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf]. My main takeaways using this critique were the following: 

* The graph was generally effective at showing the comparison of discrimation between US and California 
* The graph was effective at displaying the most prevalent and least prevalent discriminiations in order, with the most prevalent being at the top and the least being at the bottom. 
* The choice to use orange for the US incidents drew the eye too much, especially considering the intended audience is probably more interested in California's incidents 
* The title for the graph can be misleading, because it does not specify that these are only reported incidents to the Stop AAPI hate organization (versus a gross estimate)
